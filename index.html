  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>App:</strong> Mega Slotzee &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:danadeoye6@gmail.com">danadeoye6@gmail.com</a></p>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 22, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Mega Slotzee ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This document explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights with respect to that information when you download, install, access, or use our mobile application Mega Slotzee (the "App").</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
  <p>We may collect information you provide directly when you contact us, register an account (if accounts are supported), or otherwise communicate with us. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact information such as email address.</li>
    <li>Support correspondence and other messages you send to us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (for example, advertising ID, device model).</li>
    <li>Operating system and app version.</li>
    <li>Log information such as IP address, timestamps, crash reports, and performance data.</li>
    <li>Usage data such as session length, features used, and in-app events.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Analytics & Advertising</h3>
  <p>We may use third-party analytics providers (for example, Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics for mobile apps, or similar services) to understand how users engage with the App. These services collect information as described above and aggregate usage statistics. If the App displays ads, advertising partners may collect information for ad personalization and to measure ad performance.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the App and its features.</li>
    <li>Analyzing usage and performance to understand and improve the user experience.</li>
    <li>Responding to your support requests and communications.</li>
    <li>Delivering relevant in-app messages, push notifications, and (if applicable) offers.</li>
    <li>Complying with legal obligations and enforcing our terms and policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (for example, analytics providers, crash-reporting services, cloud hosting, and customer support tools).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect our rights, safety, or property.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction (with notice to affected users when required by law).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The App may use local storage mechanisms on your device (for example, app storage, SharedPreferences on Android, or similar) to store settings, game progress, and preferences. The App does not use browser cookies in the traditional web sense, but third-party SDKs integrated into the App may use identifiers for analytics and advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>The App may integrate with or link to third-party services (such as ad networks, analytics providers, or social platforms). Those third parties have their own privacy policies and controls. We are not responsible for their privacy practices—please review their privacy policies before interacting with them.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:danadeoye6@gmail.com">danadeoye6@gmail.com</a>. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 in a way that violates applicable law, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect the information we collect. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure—absolute security cannot be guaranteed. Do not send sensitive personal information (for example, Social Security numbers or financial account credentials) via insecure channels.</p>

  <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Information collected by the App may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. If you are located outside the country where data is processed, data transfers will be subject to applicable law. By using the App, you consent to such transfers.</p>

  <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, delete, or export your data. To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:danadeoye6@gmail.com">danadeoye6@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to verified requests in accordance with applicable law.</p>

  <h2>11. California Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). To make a request under California law, please contact us at <a href="mailto:danadeoye6@gmail.com">danadeoye6@gmail.com</a>. We will require information to verify your identity before responding to requests.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy. If we make material changes that materially affect your rights, we will provide notice through the App or by other means as required by law.</p>
